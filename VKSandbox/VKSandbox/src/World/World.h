/*
    Notes
    
    * Sectors
      - Each sector can or can not have a house
      - There is always a house in the first sector you DON'T spawn in
      - Each sector has a 50% chance of having a house
      - There can never be 2 sectors WITHOUT a house in a row
      - If a sector has no house, then it may be a mermaid shop sector
      - If a sector has no house, then it may be a dense woods sector, aka trees and full of enemies

    * Witches
      - they are a rarer shop than the mermaid shop
      - they sell better items
      - they hover above a fire of burning bodies
